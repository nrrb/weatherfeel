    "The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) publishes climate data through the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), with daily measurements called the [Global \\[Surface\\] Summary of Day (GSOD)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00516). Per this page, \"The data are reported and summarized based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, 0000Z - 2359Z) since the original synoptic/hourly data are reported and based on GMT.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is available in many forms, including raw CSV [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-summary-of-the-day/access/). This is organized by year, and then by a file per data-collecting station. The stations are identified by a combination of USAF (Air Force station ID) and WBAN (NCDC (National Climatic Data Center) Weather Bureau Army Navy number) identifiers. These stations are further located by latitude and longitude in this stations list file: [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv) (and in [txt](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.txt) format)\n",
